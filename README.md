# BRACES: Bible retrieval-augmented (Catholic edition) study

## Privacy, security, licences, and ethics

- I tweak & host the permissively-licenced AI model(s) behind this site (in my own time, on my own hardware, at my expense)
  + If you want, you can support my work [here](https://cdcl.ml/sponsor)
  + No data (queries, answers, IP address, etc.) are sent to any third-party
  + Answers are generated based on the Bible so should be in the public domain
- The underlying AI can sometimes misinterpret text, so please verify all biblical references/citations
- Found a bug or have a feature request? [Open an issue](https://github.com/casperdcl/braces/issues) or email `braces@cdcl.ml`
