## About

The Bible is the most studied and translated book in existence. Despite this, it is oft misinterpreted and misunderstood.
Whilst [the CCC](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm?utm_source=brace.cdcl.ml) and numerous Bible commentaries aim to aid understanding, they are not as meticulously worded as the Bible itself, and are thus significantly easier for AI to misinterpret.
This AI tool thus aims to provide insights & answers solely based on the Biblical text. The tool itself can be viewed as a bespoke commentary generator.

:writing_hand: To improve answers, try rewording and adding more details to your query. For example, instead of *"tradition vs scripture"*, ask *"Are sacred tradition and sacred scripture equally important, or is scripture more important?"*

:bug: Found a bug or have a feature request? [Open an issue](https://github.com/casperdcl/brace/issues) or email `brace@cdcl.ml`.

  + No data (queries, answers, IP addresses, etc.) are sent to any third-party
  + Answers are generated based on the Bible so should be in the public domain

  + An AI Bible *study* tool is not an authoritative Bible *substitute*
